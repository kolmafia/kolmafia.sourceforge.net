 <p class="readonly"><strong>Process impact:</strong> This page has absolutely no impact on the project, but it gives people a chance to thank those who have assisted in the development of the project in meaningful ways.</p>

 <br/>
 <h3>So what is this page for?</h3>

  <dl>

   <dd>This page is to thank all the people who have contributed to the project (at least, contributed to me) and to let you know why the project exists: because of the awesome people who stuck around to make it what it is today.  Because most bots and clients tend to be unpopular, if you'd like to be removed from this list to avoid any affiliation with this program, just send me an in-game message, email or Private Message on the forums and I will remove you before the next release.</dd>

 </dl>

 <br/>

 <h3>When I was a newbie...</h3>

  <blockquote><ul>

    <li><b>Foos Bobaganoosh</b> (#165514): Most of the people I played with communicated out of game.  So, when I went into chat, I didn't know anybody, and the only community I knew were those who were interested in PvP sniping (I'm very much a club).  Then, I was integrated into the /games culture because while I'm not great with trivia, I love listening to it.  Along that line, I'd like to thank Foos for being The Most Witty Person Ever (TM).  Nobody makes me laugh so hard.  If you have toast, send it to Foos Bobaganoosh for simply being awesome.  No actual contributions were made by Foos to the KoLmafia project, but it's like Foos trivia.  Who needs feature contributions to be recognized on this page?  </li>

   <br>

    <li><b>Alecat</b> (#115209): For sending me a pixelated heart when I wandered into /haiku for the first time.  Valentines-type presents, no matter how randomly sent, are excellent pick-me-ups.  Have you done your random act of kindness today?  For me, knowing that there were people who enjoyed random acts of kindness made me feel that starting out with the project was not such a bad idea, since if these people would stick around, this game would truly grow and develop in crazy ways.</li>

   <br>

    <li><b>Bashy</b> (#91072): Back when I was a newbie, the only clans I really heard about were Warehouse 23 and ... well, that was it, actually, and there was a sense of disconnection between Warehouse 23 and the rest of the community, or that maybe the game felt too much like a clique.  However, after hanging around the forums more, I started to recognize that there were a lot of individuals in the sea of cliques, and the strongest presence would have been Bashy.  So I'd like to thank Bashy for being Bashy.  Need I say more? :D  Bashy is awesome beyond all limits of Bashyness, if that's possible or makes any sense.</li>

  </ul></blockquote>

 <h3>Inspiration for starting out...</h3>

  <blockquote><ul>

    <li><b>Papa Zito</b> (#24912): For creating <a href="http://kolmelion.sourceforge.net">KoLmelion</a>.  The <a href="http://forums.kingdomofloathing.com/viewtopic.php?t=11365">KoLmelion thread</a> is where all of KoLmafia's initial ideas originated.  Almost all the user interface concepts were hijacked from KoLmelion, as well as all the adventure identifiers (it's why the Pickle Factory ID was available in all the pre-v1.9 releases).  So, if you're looking for someone to thank for interface cleanliness or adventuring functionality, Papa Zito should be your first choice.</li>

   <br>

    <li><b>Ragnok</b> (#49653): For creating <a href="http://www.subjunctive.net/kol/kolcli.html">KoL CLI</a>, which, through its documentation alone, is an excellent reference for anyone designing a KoL client.  Many feature ideas came about through observing the <a href="http://forums.kingdomofloathing.com/viewtopic.php?t=15811">KoL CLI thread</a>, especially the item usage concepts.  Ragnok's also assisted in KoLmafia's development through the skill chart that's built into KoL CLI and the moon phases chart found on <a href="http://www.subjunctive.net/kol/FrontPage.html">Subjunctive KoL</a>.  If you'd like to send a thank you for KoLmafia's skill tracker and moon phases display, or the ability to eat and drink from the client, I recommend sending a thank you to Ragnok.</li>

   <br>

    <li><b>Ohayou</b> (#64935): For creating the be-all, end-all tradeable item list reference.  Ohayou's <a href="http://www.brainsander.com/nt/board/viewforum.php?f=3">scriplets</a> are also the most kickass browser customizations in existence.  KoLmafia's item management functionalities would probably not have existed without Ohayou's easy-to-parse <a href="http://www.lysator.liu.se/~jhs/KoL/scriptlets/dump.rxml">item table</a>.  So, if you enjoy the convenience of the item manager, I recommend sending a thank you to Ohayou.</li>

   <br>

    <li><b>PoolAce</b> (#7977): I was told recently by Elazar that PoolAce was the person who created the most wonderful recipe table ever.  KoLmafia's original item creation capabilities are owed almost completely to <a href="http://www.agesoftime.com/kol/index.php">KoL Helper</a> (which has since been domain squatted *tear*).  So, if you'd like to send a thank you for KoLmafia's item creation engine, I recommend sending a thank you to PoolAce.</li>
  </ul></blockquote>

 <h3>Seeing it through the initial stages...</h3>

  <blockquote><ul>

    <li><b>Zana</b> (#285109): For entertaining me by downloading <a href="http://javashoplm.sun.com/ECom/docs/Welcome.jsp?StoreId=22&PartDetailId=jre-1.5.0_01-oth-JPR&SiteId=JSC&TransactionId=noreg">JRE 1.5.0_01</a> over a dialup connection and trying out <a href="https://sourceforge.net/project/shownotes.php?release_id=292391">v0.2</a>.  The character pane (back then) was super-glitchy, and if it wasn't for Zana's patience, it would never have worked.  So, if you like the convenience of viewing your status pane while using KoLmafia, I recommend sending a thank you to Zana.</li>

   <br>

    <li><b>WoodenPlank</b> (#297051): For being the guinea pig for my program back when it was in <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/shownotes.php?release_id=292393">v0.3</a> and being really nice about the super-frequent updates back when I used to send the JAR files by email.  WoodenPlank's input is what encouraged the addition of the shrine donation meat sinks and the ability to add things to your store.  If you like the shrine donations and the automall interface, I recommend sending a thank you to WoodenPlank.</li>

   <br>

    <li><b>OlyveOyle</b> (#286273): For trying out my program back when it was in <a href="https://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=126572&package_id=138474&release_id=293270">v0.4</a> and giving me ideas for features all along the way up until v0.9.  She was especially interested in the development of chat, and that's why so much effort was placed in the design of KoLmafia's PM system (it's what she wanted to see completed).  If you'd like to thank anyone for chat's PM system, I recommend sending a thank you note to OlyveOyle.</li>

  </ul></blockquote>

 <h3>Moral support as the project went public...</h3>

  <blockquote><ul>

    <li><b>Darwinlet</b> (#263717): For finding and helping me pinpoint a lot of bugs.  And I mean a <i>lot</i> of bugs.  Especially Macintosh-specific bugs that I would not have found on my own.  Throughout most of KoLmafia's public existence, Darwinlet's practically functioned like my right-hand man, answering forum questions and providing detailed user feedback which is every open source developer's dream.  If you're a Macintosh user, you should definitely send a thank you to Darwinlet.</li>

   <br>

    <li><b>Nikademus</b> (#95105): For posting a message about KoLmafia v0.9's release on <a href="http://kol.coldfront.net/index.php">KoL Coldfront</a>; it gave me a ridiculous artificial high when I found out about it.  Eventually, KoL Coldfront became my final resource for status effects, skills and class names, helping me resolve a lot of bugs that I couldn't have done alone.  If you want to send a thank you for class-specific features, I recommend sending a thank you to Nikademus.</li>

   <br>

    <li><b>Presto Ragu</b> (#77470): For helping a lot with the adventure tracker.  Almost every bug that's occurred regarding the adventure tracker, Presto Ragu has managed to locate, report, and detail to a degree high enough that bugfixing is a breeze.  If you like the adventure tracker, I recommend sending a thank you to Presto Ragu.</li>

   <br>

    <li><b>ShadowsLight</b> (#101130): For giving me ideas on how to change the user interface in a very intuitive fashion.  The increments button and the breakfast checkbox are probably two of the most popular recent features.  So, if you like the nifty new breakfast feature or are a hermit lover who hated the exploding statue, I recommend sending a thank you to ShadowsLight.</li>

   <br>

    <li><b>Elazar</b> (#95553): For sending me an email out of nowhere congratulating me on the release of KoLmafia v0.9, and being there on Y!IM to bounce ideas off of when I'm thinking about what feature(s) to implement next, and for correcting me whenever I make random mistakes (like not knowing who was responsible for KoL Helper).  If you like to thank random honest people, and are thankful that KoLmafia is continuing development (because it does get rather boring if there's no one to bounce ideas off of), I recommend sending a thank you to Elazar.</li>

   <br>

    <li><b>Wormwood</b> (#44826): For being patient through KoLmafia's early chat engine, providing bug reports that made it really easy to track everything down.  If you'd like to thank anyone for the multi-window channel system being as smoothe as it is (or maybe was), I recommend sending a thank you to Wormwood.  Wormwood also introduced the concept of a tabbed chat to me in a forum PM (as opposed to the multi-window system), and as KoLmafia progressed, this tabbed chat was finally added, hopefully as it was initially envisioned.  If you like tabs in chat, or just chat in general, be sure to send a thank-you to Wormwood.</li>

   <br>

    <li><b>Aprocalypse</b> (#224321): For getting me interested in buying bulk at retail prices, and for introducing the multi-window concept to chat.  That huge 10 meat sale at Christmas and the hour I spent clicking away to help contribute caused me to snap and add in mall functionality.  If you'd like to thank anyone for the mallbot-like buying powers, I recommend sending a thank you to Aprocalypse.  Or you can thank Aprocalypse for the multi-window chat, which is less controversial.</li>

  </ul></blockquote>

 <h3>Technical contributions...</h3>

  <blockquote><ul>

    <li><b>Veracity</b> (#121572): For doing a lot of development in KoLmafia behind-the-scenes, ranging from user interface tweaks to cross-platform compatibility issues to brand-new features and area-access.  Also many thanks for keeping me sane throughout the crazy KoLmafia development cycles in the immediate pre-ascension era and for putting in a lot of time and effort in KoLmafia's post-ascension development.  So, if you're thankful for the increasing stability of KoLmafia as time goes on, I recommend sending a thank you to Veracity.</li>

   <br>

    <li><b>raney53</b> (#197024): For producing the foundation, the brainwork, the bugfixing, the alpha-tester army, the enhancements and basically everything related to KoLmafia's shiny new buffbot feature, which was formally released in v2.8 and which has since experienced (and continues to experience) bugfixes and enhancements.  Most of the ideas and implementation were done with raney53, while I just sped the process along with obscene update speed. :D  If you really love the buffbot feature, I recommend sending a thank you to raney53 and the Helper of Newbies clan.</li>

   <br>

    <li><b>Xylpher</b> (#540421): Without question, two of the most popular features of KoLmafia today are the familiar trainer and the Advanced Script Handler implemented by Xylpher.  While Veracity has taken over the projects since then and evolved them, Xylpher provided the base for evolving the project.  In addition to this, one of Xylpher's lesser-known contributions include ensuring that clan snapshots from the pre White Wednesday era could be integrated together with existing clan snapshots in order to provide data continuity for people interested in maintaining clan histories.  If you love any of those features, I recommend sending a thank you to Xylpher.</li>

   <br>

    <li><b>bigfreak</b> (#692131): For helping assist with the development of KoLmafia over a long six month stretch.  In spite of disagreeing with KoLmafia's development direction and parting ways with the project, the project owes a lot of its growth to bigfreak's work, including (but not limited to) the inspiration behind choice adventure spoilers and moods along with the implementation of KoLmafia's relay browser.  So, eventhough he probably wants to disassociate himself with the project in order to start fresh in the Greasemonkey era, if you benefit or love any of the features which bigfreak contributed, I recommend sending a thank you to bigfreak.</li>

  </ul></blockquote>

 <h3>The clans that kept me around...</h3>

  <blockquote><ul>

    <li><b>Cool Guy Crew</b> (Clan #672): A lot of people criticize the clans that have an open door policy, but you will never see me adding to that chorus of criticism.  Most of my friends quit the game soon after joining, or were fairly inactive (only stopping in to farm the hole in the sky or other high level areas), and the only sense of community I knew I learned from this open-door clan (joining it with a multi).  After considering myself to not be a newbie after a month or so, I parted ways with CGC, but that sense that there is a community out there kept me around for at least a month.  I owe a lot to CGC, and some long-time followers of the project might have noticed that I respond a lot more quickly to CGC bug reports than anyone else's.</li>

   <br>

    <li><b>Helper of Newbies</b> (Clan #5403): I get the impression from some people that I get a lot of clan invites and/or white lists.  That couldn't be further from the truth, and HON was the first clan (out of a grand total of five clans) to break the ice on that.  Isadore and raney53 were really my first close friends in the game, but the clan was extremely quiet, being a newbie-oriented clan, and eventually, Isadore and raney53 disappeared from the game due to real life restrictions.  But, this is the first clan I felt I was a member of, and it kept me in touch with people who were just getting started with the game like I had, and I wanted them to be as inspired as me, without letting them know about the bot program that could kill all that, if used too early.  Once Isadore and raney53 went near-inactive, I parted ways with the clan.</li>

   <br>

    <li><b>Renegades of Funk</b> (Clan #17023): I mentioned earlier that I started out PvPing sniping before entering the /games culture, and really, the clan that kept me interested in /games was Renegades of Funk.  I looked forward to going into /games to watch the crazy trivia games that RoF would host seemingly 24/7 and I thought these people were the smartest, wittiest, most amazing people ever.  One of my goals was to eventually apply to the clan (they had an Application, and that made it seem really exclusive), but then /games died for unknown reasons and with them no longer being around as often, I saw my chances of qualifying for the clan go up in smoke.  However, if you wanted to know why I stuck with the game until I started working on KoLmafia, this clan is part of the reason why.</li>

   <br>

    <li><b>Ballad of Fallen Angels</b> (Clan #32122): This has been the clan that's kept me here over the past year.  They've always been people I can identify with, people with a laid-back attitude towards the game, with a chat that's not so active it's /newbie but not so quiet it's /haiku.  I consider the members of BoFA among my closest friends still playing this game (and people I worship much as I did the members of RoF, which is no surprise, as BoFA was initially comprised of many former RoF members), and a lot of my still playing the game has been driven by the enthusiasm toward a social game of KoL that BoFA has, which is the kind of game I have always played since the /trade days.  If you want to thank anyone for the fact that I haven't quit the game yet, this is the clan to thank.</li>

   <br>

    <li><b>Otori</b> (Clan #11088): I received an invite from Otori in response to a lot of work that was done preparing the first ever One Meat Ode bot (sneaksie), based off of the buffbot engine provided by raney53.  In my time with Otori, I have to say that Otori has some of the most amazing personalities this game will ever see.  Otori has a randomness dynamic that, while difficult to identify with from the outside, makes perfect sense from the inside.  The sense of mutual respect that I have for a great many of its members, as well as the admiration I have for its Code of Honor, has kept me around the game for a long time.  Otori is really an amazing clan that suited my clubbiness very well (racing for the clan attack spot stands as one of my favorite game activities), and were it not for Otori's existence, helping satiate the club half of me, the game probably would have gotten boring a long time ago.</li>

   <br>

    <li><b>Iocaine Powder</b> (Clan #7046): Following the /games era, I moved over into /trade, and there I met the members of what would be Iocaine Powder.  To be honest, I have no idea if they were members of IP at the time (by doing a /whois, I know they are now), but many of them were people I practically worshipped when I first entered the /trade culture (you know, before it became /foodcourt).  If it weren't for various current members of IP practically embodying the third era of philanthropic players while I was in /trade, the belief that philanthropy through an open source project being a Way Cool Idea ... well, it would never have happened to begin with, even with the existence of KoLmelion.  So, if you're curious, "Why did you make KoLmafia free, ambitious, and available to everyone in the first place?" this clan's members are a big part of the reason why.  At least, the hearts among them.  The clubs ... not so sure about that one. ^_~</li>

   <br>

    <li><b>Noblesse Oblige</b> (Clan #4242): The relaxed feel that Noblesse Oblige has towards the game, in spite of its power players and record-breaking feats, is more or less the approach I take when working on KoLmafia.  As such, the clan credo for Noblesse Oblige appeals to me on so many levels, and the kinds of players inside of that clan are the kinds of players I think about when I work on KoLmafia.  I don't give heavy weight towards the opinions of meat farmers, item farmers, rare farmers, or any other crowd of diamond players.  My hope is that the players who keep the game interesting through their generosity and through their being role models ... I hope these players want to stick around and keep the game amazing.  So while I'm playing the game, and these kinds of players are still playing the game, the project feels very much alive, and it's these kinds of players, and indeed the clan itself, that have kept the project alive after the initial inspiration happened.</li>

 <h3>Do you guys collect anything?</h3>

  <dl>

   <dd>Of course!  A <a href="http://kolmafia.us/showthread.php?7985-Who-collects-what">forum post</a> on the KoLmafia describes what the developers and other contributors collect.</dd>

   <dd>If you sweatdrop at the idea of manipulating the market in order to fund KoLmafia developer collections, you are more than welcome to send us a surprise.  Remember: many of us are here because KoL amuses us, and if you'd like to do anything quirky, it's totally in the spirit of the game.</dd>

   <dd>A no-longer maintained list of in-game donations to holatuwol (#458968) from before I stopped playing the game regularly is available <a href="donations.xml">here</a>.  If you're curious what a clan bricking looks like, check <a href="noblesse.html">here</a>.</dd>
